1) What are the advantages/disadvantages to both passing by reference
and value?
Passing by reference allows the variables value in memory to be directly changed
allowing changes to be changed outside the scope of the function. This can be an
advantage when needing to access multiple variables outside the function, but
can also make tracking changes to variables more difficult as a programmer.

Passing by value allows the variables value to only be changed within the scope 
of the function but not externally. This can be advantagious in situations were
the function should change only one value (with a return) or should change no
values. A disadvantage, however, is that one one variable can be easily, without
pointers/arrays, updated outside of the functions scope.

 
2) Write a function that accumulates a running total, adding the
input parameter each function call (e.g. static variable).  If the
number gets over 1,000, exit.

#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

using namespace std;

void func( int num );

void func( int num ){
    if( num > 1000 ){
        exit( EXIT_SUCCESS );
    }else{
        cout << num+num << endl;
        func( num+num );
    }
}

int main(){
    func( 10 );
}
