Mini-Lab #2

Complete the following and hand in all answers and/or code.  Submit on Blackboard.  Late assignments will be penalized 15 points per 24 hour period.  You are to work independently and any collaboration will be penalized as described in the syllabus.


1) Write a program that reads an input of a grade (A through F, no + or -).  If the grade is outside of the range, return an error and warn the user.  Output the range of the score that fits the grade (e.g. A is 100 to 90, B is 89 to 80, C is 79 to 70, D is 69 to 60, F is under 60.)
	a) Use an if statement.
	b) Use the same code, but change it to use a switch statement.

-----------------------------------------	
2) Find the bug:
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main(){
		int number;
		cout << "Enter a number ";
		cin >> number;
		if(number = 10)  // should be ==, = is for variable assignment.
			cout << "?!?!?!" << endl;
		if(number < 10)
			cout << "!!!!!!" << endl;
		if(number > 10)
			cout << "??????" << endl;
	}

-----------------------------------------
3) What is the outcome of the following code? Explain WHY.
	x = 5;
	if(x++ > 5)
		cout << "Greater!";
	else
		cout << "Not!";
		
Output is "Not!" because the x variable is post-incremented, meaning it is not increased
to 6 until after the if-else statement.
		
-----------------------------------------
4) What if we change #3's code to ++x? Explain (not just coding it)

Output with ++x changes the output to "Greater!" because the x variable is pre-incremented,
meaning the x value is increased to 6 before the current statement.

-----------------------------------------
5) Rank the 3 types of loops (do-while, while, for).  What is the basis of your ranking.

1. while
    - maintains code readability for multiple types while allowing significant customizations
2. do-while
    - ranks 2nd because the desired behavior, while infrequent, is not easily replicated
    in a readable manner.
3. for
    - for loop is 3rd because, although it is ysed frequently, it is basically a shorthand 
    implementation of a while loop
        int i = 0;
        while( i < 8 ){
            // code
            i++;
        }
