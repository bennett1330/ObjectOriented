1) Explain the algorithm in comments:

	int main() {
		cout << "5 numbers";
		int a, b, c, d, e;
		cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e; // Reads first 5 integer input values from
		                              // console input. (Must be space seperated
		                              // additional input will be ignored.)
		int x;
		x = a + b + c + d + e;        // x is set equal to the sum of the values
		                              // of the integers a, b, ..., e.
		int f;
		f = x/5;                      // f is set equal to the value x, the sum
		                              // of the entered integers, divided by 5.
		                              // This is the average of the entered
		                              // values. Any decimimal places are
		                              // rounded down
		                              // f = floorOf( average( a, b, ..., e ) )

2) Describe in pseudocode how to make light come from a lamp.  Be as detailed, 
comprehensive, and descriptive as possible.  This should include if something 
doesn't go as planned/expected.

    Locate on knob or button.
    Turn knob or press button to on position.
    **Loop**
    Check if light is on.
    If the light is on:
        Good job, you're done.
        End program.
    If the light is NOT on:
        Check if light is plugged in.
        If light is NOT plugged in:
            Locate outlet.
            Plug in light.
            Next loop iteration (continue).
        Check if lightblub is in lamp.
        If light bulb is NOT in lamp:
            Locate light bulb.
            Screw in light bulb.
            Next loop iteration (continue).
        Check if power works in another room.
        If power is NOT on in other room:
            The gods have given you a mighty excuse to go have a drink.
            End program. Try again in an hour.
        Check if lamp turns on when plugged into outlet in other room.
        If lamp does NOT work in other room:
            Find a company name and product number.
            Ask google why your lamp doesn't work.
            Obey the Googles.
            Next Loop iteration (continue).
