1) Show me the steps for a binary search of the following sorted array for the 
number 15.

		1     8		10		14		16		26		50
                            ^^
        14 (at middle index 3) < 15; number must be at index > 3
        
		1     8		10		14		16		26		50
                                            ^^        
        26 (at new middle index 5) > 15; number must be 3 < index < 5
        
        16 (at new middle index 4) > 15; number must be 3 < index < 4
        
        index must be a whole integer; 15 is not in the list


2) Using bubble sort, sort the following array.
		100     75     25     50     0
		
        Compare 100 to 75; Swap
        Compare 100 to 25; Swap
        Compare 100 to 50; Swap
        Compare 100 to 0; Swap
        
        75     25     50     0     100
        
        Compare 75 to 25; Swap
        Compare 75 to 50; Swap
        Compare 75 to 0; Swap
        Compare 75 to 100; No change
        
        25     50     0     75     100
        
        Compare 25 to 50; No change
        Compare 50 to 0; Swap
        Compare 50 to 75; No change
        Compare 75 to 100; No change
        
        25     0     50     75     100
        
        
        Compare 25 to 0; Swap
        Compare 25 to 50; No change
        Compare 50 to 75; No change
        Compare 75 to 100; No change
        
        0     25     50     75     100
        
        Sort complete since no change on last run through.

3) Using selection sort, sort the above array.
        100     75     25     50     0
        
        Compare 100 to 75; 75 Set as low value
        Compare 75 to 25; 25 Set as low value
        Compare 25 to 50; No change
        Compare 25 to 0; 0 Set as low value
        0 and 100 switched
        
        0     75     25     50     100
        
        Compare 75 to 25; 25 Set as low value
        Compare 25 to 50; No change
        Compare 25 to 100; No change
        75 and 25 switched
        
        0     25     75      50      100
        
        Compare 75 to 50; 50 Set to low value
        Compare 50 to 100; No change
        75 and 50 switched
        
        0     25     50     75     100
        
        Compare 75 to 100; 75 Set to low value
        75 "switched" with 75
        
        Sort complete since all indexes have been iterated over.

4) Assume you start with an unsorted array.  Should you sort then search? Or 
just use a linear search? Why?

The worst case of a linear search requires each array value to be compared
to the search value.
The best case of sort of a presorted array, each array value to be compared 
to the next array value.
If the worst case of linear search is comparable to the best case of just the
sort without even considering the additional time of the linear search, it is 
clear that, unless the array must be sorted for later use, a linear search 
should be used.
